* in this folder you will find the (renamed) Porpoise.java altered to include the three condition mediation functions
* the original file can be found in DEPONS/src/dk/au/bios/porpoise/ in the original DEPONS 
* I would suggest simply altering the function in your DEPONS implementation
* the alterations are in the function deter (lines 1230-1245) in all three files
* details of the functions can be found in the paper accompanying this code
